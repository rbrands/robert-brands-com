# Personal CMS for robert-brands.com

This site is my personal web site and provides a very simple CMS. I use it to share photos, roadbike tracks, travel tips etc. But first of all it demonstrates some features around development with 

- ASP.NET Core with Razor Pages
- Authentication with Azure AD
- Azure Table Storage
- NoSQL Datenbank Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Web-Apps
- Responsive Design with Bootstrap
- GitHub Actions

Feel free to use it as start for your own development or to understand and see examples of the mentioned technologies.
